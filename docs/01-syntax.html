        <h1>Syntax</h1>
        <p>
        The syntax of &amp; was designed from the ground up and isn't influenced
        by the syntax of any language in particular.  Any similarities are a
        mere conincidence.
        </p>

        <h2>Spaces</h2>
        <p>
        The first important feature of the syntax is that whitespaces are not
        optional, nevertheless they are insignificant. How does this work?
        Whitespaces are required to divide words.  However multiple whitespace
        act the same as a single whitespace. Also, it doesn't matter if you use
        spaces, tabs, newlines or unicode whitespaces.  They're all equal.  The
        reasoning behind this is to ensure that good style is always used.
        There is only a handful of special symbols that don't require
        whitespaces to be separated from identifiers or operators &mdash; because
        identifiers and operators are one and the same.  This is another
        important feature of the syntax.  

        <h2>Words</h2>
        <p>
        There is no syntactival distinction between operators, identifiers and
        keywords.  Keywords are simply builtin functions, macros or intrinsics
        (more on macros and intrinsics in a later chapter).  Operators are
        simply binary or unary functions (or macros or intrinsics).
        </p>

        <p>
        Collectively these are known as words.
        </p>

        <h2>Program structure</h2>
        <p>
        An &amp; program consists of statements.
        <code class="inline">def program = any* statement;</code>
        A statement is semicolon-terminated expression.
        <code class="inline">
            def statement = expression and ";";
        </code>
        An expression is a word followed by a sequence of words.
        <code class="inline">def expression = word and word-sequence;</code>
        Words include: number literals, string literals, character literals,
        identifiers (paths), index literals, blocks, enclosed expressions and
        pairs.
        <code class="inline">
            def word = or number, string, character, identifier, index, block, enclosed, pair;
        </code>
        Every identifier is a path.  A path consists of atoms.  Atoms are not
        elements of the grammar, they are only conceptual units.  Blocks are
        lists of statements with an optional expression at the end.
        <code class="inline">
            def block = and "{", any* statement, opt expression, "}";
        </code>
        Enclosed statements are tuples or arrays, with tuples being
        parentheses-enclosed and arrays being bracket-enclosed.
        <code class="block">
def enclosed = tuple or array;
def tuple = and "(", any* statement, opt expression, ")";
def tuple = and "[", any* statement, opt expression, "]";
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>
        And here's a more complete example of &amp; syntax.  The syntax tree for
        this program will be reviewed in the next chapter.
        <code class="block">
mod main;
use io/print, string/fmt;

let greeting = "Hello, {}!";
let who = "world";
print $ fmt greeting, who;
print $ fmt "{}", 1 + 2;

let zero? n = n == 0;
def fib n = (fib n - 1) + (fib n - 2);
        </code>
        </p>
